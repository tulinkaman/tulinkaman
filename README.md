Hello ðŸ‘‹  

My name is Tulin Kaman. I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Arkandas. 

My research interest is in modeling and simulation specifically computational fluid dynamics and turbulence, numerical methods for partial differential equations with computer aspects of numerical algorithms and uncertainty quantificiation. My recent work includes the development new efficient and optimized front tracking method for the numerical simulation of multiphase flows.
