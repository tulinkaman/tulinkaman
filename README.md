Hello ðŸ‘‹  

My name is Tulin Kaman. I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Arkandas. 

My research interests are at the intersection of modeling and simulations in computational fluid dynamics and turbulence, numerical methods for stochastic partial differential equations, scientific parallel computing and uncertainty quantification. My research involves the study of the turbulent mixing and turbulent combustion to understand the physical instability mechanism on the important scientific and engineering problems.
